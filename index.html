        <p>Everyone has a story â€” an email sent to the wrong person, a text taken out of context, a work conflict that seems impossible to resolve. These digital miscommunications have become universal experiences in our connected world. Technology has transformed how we communicate, creating both opportunities and challenges in our personal and professional lives. My research at the intersection of communication and technology explores critical issues like cyberbullying, technology's role in relationships, and other online social dynamics, which allows me to help organizations and individuals translate this knowledge into practical strategies that improve digital interactions. Through speaking engagements, workshops, and consulting, I offer evidence-based approaches to the communication challenges we all face in our increasingly connected world.</p>
